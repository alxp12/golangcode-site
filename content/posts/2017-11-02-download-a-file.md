This example shows how to download a file from the web on to your local machine. By using `io.Copy()` and passing the response body directly in we stream the data to the file and avoid having to load it all into the memory - it's not a problem with small files, but it makes a difference when downloading large files.

We also have an example of [downloading large files with progress reports](/download-a-file-with-progress).

If you want to use the filename from the url, you can replace the `filepath` variable in DownloadFile with `path.Base(resp.Request.URL.String())` and import the `path` package.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	fileUrl := "https://golangcode.com/logo.svg"
	err := DownloadFile("logo.svg", fileUrl)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Downloaded: " + fileUrl)
}

// DownloadFile will download a url to a local file. It's efficient because it will
// write as it downloads and not load the whole file into memory.
func DownloadFile(filepath string, url string) error {

	// Get the data
	resp, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	// Create the file
	out, err := os.Create(filepath)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer out.Close()

	// Write the body to file
	_, err = io.Copy(out, resp.Body)
	return err
}
```
