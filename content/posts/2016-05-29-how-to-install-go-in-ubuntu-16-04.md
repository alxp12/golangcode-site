Ubuntu does come with a version of go (installable through `apt install go`) but it won't be as up-to-date as downloading it directly. And I know many gophers like using the latest version.

To begin with we'll start by downloading the latest version and, once downloaded, we extract it into a folder we can work with (you can find the [latest version here](https://golang.org/dl/)).

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

```bash
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf go1.14.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

We then need to add some environment variables so Go knows where our work/code directory is located. GOPATH should point to the folder where you'll be working in. This folder once setup should have your `src`, `bin` and `pkg` folders.

```bash
vim ~/.profile
```

Add this to the bottom:

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

Press `:wq` to exit and run this to load your changes:

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

As the final test, if we run this:

```bash
go version
```

We should see: `go version go1.14.2 linux/amd64`

Finally, some clean-up

```bash
rm go1.14.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
