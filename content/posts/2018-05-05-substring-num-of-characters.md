In the example below we are looking at how to take the first x number of characters from the start of a string. If we know a character we want to separate on, like a space, we can use `strings.Split()` instead. But for this we're looking to get the first 6 characters as a new string.

To do this we first convert it into a rune, allowing for better support in different languages and allowing us to use it like an array. Then we pick the first characters using `[0:6]` and converting it back to a string.

### Split Based on Position:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {

	myString := "Hello! This is a golangcode.com test ;)"

	// Step 1: Convert it to a rune
	a := []rune(myString)

	// Step 2: Grab the num of chars you need
	myShortString := string(a[0:6])

	fmt.Println(myShortString)
}
```

### Split Based on Character:

The alternative way, using the `strings` package would be:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {

	myString := "Hello! This is a golangcode.com test ;)"

	strParts := strings.Split(myString, "!")

	fmt.Println(strParts[0])
}
```
