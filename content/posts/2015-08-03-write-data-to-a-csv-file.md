CSV is a highly accepted data language, commonly used by Excel and spreadsheets, and as such is very useful if your script is producing data and you want it in a common format.

In the example, we're forming a data variable, just to illustrate the example, by creating a multi-dimensional array of strings. We are then having to [create a file][1] (result.csv) for the csv writer to work with. Finally, we are iterating through the data writing each line to the file.

```go
package main

import (
    "os"
    "log"
    "encoding/csv"
)

var data = [][]string{{"Line1", "Hello Readers of"}, {"Line2", "golangcode.com"}}

func main() {
    file, err := os.Create("result.csv")
    checkError("Cannot create file", err)
    defer file.Close()

    writer := csv.NewWriter(file)
    defer writer.Flush()

    for _, value := range data {
        err := writer.Write(value)
        checkError("Cannot write to file", err)
    }
}

func checkError(message string, err error) {
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(message, err)
    }
}
```

The result:

```
Line1,Hello Readers of
Line2,golangcode.com
```

This process is possible through two packages, `os` and `encoding/csv` - one which handles the file interactions the other which converts the data structure into csv format.
